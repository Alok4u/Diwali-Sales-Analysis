# Diwali Sales Data Analysis using Google Colab

This repository contains a data analysis project that focuses on Diwali sales data. The analysis was performed using Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment, to explore and extract insights from the sales data related to the Diwali festival.

## Project Overview

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is a significant cultural and commercial event in many parts of the world. This analysis aims to understand sales trends, patterns, and key factors that contribute to sales during the Diwali period.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Google Colab**: The analysis was conducted using Google Colab due to its ease of use, built-in libraries, and ability to work with data in a collaborative environment.

- **Python**: Python programming language was used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

- **Pandas**: Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library, was utilized to clean and preprocess the sales data.

- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: These libraries were used to create visualizations such as line plots, bar graphs, and scatter plots to showcase sales trends.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Collection**: The raw sales data for Diwali was collected from the provided sources. This data included information about products, prices, quantities sold, and timestamps.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: The collected data was cleaned by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and converting data types as needed.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA involved generating summary statistics, creating visualizations, and identifying initial trends in the data. Some of the key aspects explored include:
   - Total sales over the Diwali period.
   - Most popular products based on sales quantity.
   - Price distribution of products.
   - Sales trends over the years (if applicable).

4. **Seasonal Analysis**: The analysis delved into understanding how sales were affected by the Diwali season. This involved comparing sales data before, during, and after Diwali to identify any significant changes.

5. **Correlation Analysis**: Relationships between different variables, such as product price and sales quantity, were explored to understand the factors influencing sales.

6. **Insights and Findings**: Based on the analysis, key insights were drawn, including which products performed exceptionally well during Diwali, how pricing influenced sales, and any observable patterns.

## Files in the Repository
